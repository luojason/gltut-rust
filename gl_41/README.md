# gl_41

This is a clone of the `gl-rs` package, which provides OpenGL language bindings.
Find the upstream repository at https://github.com/brendanzab/gl-rs.

All this package changes w.r.t. `gl-rs` is that it downgrades the loaded OpenGL version to 4.1,
which is the last supported version on most MacOS systems per https://support.apple.com/en-us/101525.
